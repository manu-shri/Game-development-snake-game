OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:
PROJECT: SNAKE GAME
Snake Movement: The snake moves in the direction indicated by the arrow keys. The body of the snake follows the head as it moves.
Food: The snake grows when it eats the food (red square), and the food spawns at a random location.
Game Over: The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.
Minimal Rendering: Only the snake and food are drawn on the window. No score or extra UI elements.
